Description: Analysis of experimental multi-parent populations (MPPs) to detect
             regions of the genome (called quantitative trait loci, QTLs)
             influencing phenotypic traits. The MPPs must be composed of crosses
             between a set of at least three parents (e.g. factorial design,
             diallel, or nested association mapping). The functions covers data
             processing, QTL detection, and results visualization.
